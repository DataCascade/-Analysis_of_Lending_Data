Explored loan repayment prediction using lending data from 2007 to 2010.
Analyzed the correlation between LendingClub.com's credit policy criteria and borrowers' FICO scores, indicating FICO scores' role in determining creditworthiness.
Identified a trend associating higher FICO scores with increased likelihood of full debt repayment, suggesting FICO scores as reliable indicators of repayment behavior.
Investigated the impact of loan purposes, such as debt consolidation and credit card usage, on repayment probabilities, providing valuable insights for risk assessment.
Highlighted the trade-off between precision and recall in decision tree and random forest models, with decision trees achieving higher precision and random forests achieving better recall.
Evaluated model performance using metrics including average precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the models' ability to identify borrowers who will fully repay their loans accurately.
Achieved relatively high accuracy scores for both models, with the Random Forest model outperforming the Decision Tree model.
Recorded an accuracy score of approximately 0.729 for the Decision Tree Model and approximately 0.846 for the Random Forest Model.
